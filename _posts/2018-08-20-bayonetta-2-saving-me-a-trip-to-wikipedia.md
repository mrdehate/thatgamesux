![Bayonetta pointing a large gun very close to the camera with the caption "Let's Dance, Boys"](images/bayonetta2-letsdance-1024x576.jpg)For most games, as soon as I see the credits roll, I immediately grab my phone and go to Wikipedia to read the summary of the game's plot. I've got to be honest here, I'm alwaysÂ _somewhere_ on the confusion spectrum. Occasionally I have no idea what happened - I'm looking at you Final Fantasy XV - but usually it's a point or two that I may have missed.

I just wrapped up Bayonetta 2, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they at least tried to save me the trip. In Bayonetta 2 you gather up lore books as you progress through the levels, written from the POV of a journalist. Upon completing the story, you get one more entry automatically added for you that contains a recap of the game's plot.
