Welcome to That Game's UX.  Lots of places talk about games on the internet.  Graphics, sound, difficulty, it's all discussed.  But we want to look deeper.  What about the design decisions that went into getting you acquainted with the game?  What about the menus that you have to go through every time you start it up?  Or the controls that you constantly have to fiddle with?

It's time that the user experience world meets the gaming world.  Because gamers are users too.

We're just getting setup here, but stay tuned.
